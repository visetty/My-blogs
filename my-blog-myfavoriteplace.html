    <h1>Banff and Jasper National Parks</h1>
    <p>There are many places I have visited in and around United states.</p>
    <p>when I got a chance to cross the border the first place I visited in Canada is the <em>Banff National park</em>. It was love at first sight.</p>
    <h2>Beauty of the Parks</h2>
    <p>Canadian Rocky Mountains are stretched across Banff and Jasper parks.I have not seen such huge mountain ranges till date, so I felt as if I was in aother world.
      All along the way betwen Banff and Jasper you see the mountains reaching the sky, beautiful lakes along the way, waterfalls, glaciers and much more.</p>

    <p>All the lakes are so mesmerising and of all the lakes <strong>Lake Louise</strong> steals the show.You feel like you are in <em>Paradise</em> when you are at <strong>Lake Louise</strong>. The torquoise, glacier surrounded lake gives breath talking views.
      The water looks blue, green and sparkly.</p>
