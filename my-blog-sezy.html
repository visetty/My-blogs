        <img src="sezy.png" alt="Sezy my pom">
        <p>It was a big surprise for me and my brothers when my aunt bought us a puppy as a gift. My mom was not sure if we kids will be able to take care of something that needs constatnt attention.
        To her surprise we did pretty good job in the first week.</p>
        <p>well all I am talking is about our dog Sezy. It is a Pomeranian breed. Sezy was just 8 weeks old when she came to us. when he came to our house as a puppy he was like a little furry doll any kid would play with. His fur is as white as snow angel.
        Being a young kid when puppy came, all i can think is to play with him when ever i get time.</p>
